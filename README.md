## Machine Learning algorithm implementation in python without scikit-learn 
#### 1. Linear Regression:
> Program that implements a (batch) linear regression using the gradient descent method in Python 3.

#### 2. Decision Tree:
> Program that implements a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm.
Information Gain as your decision measure and treat all features as discrete multinomial distributions.
There are the two data sets named car and nursery as csv files.
Both data sets can be learned perfectly, i.e. all leaves have an entropy of 0. The output
of algorithm is tree in XML format

#### 3. Perceptron:
> Program that implements a single perceptron using the delta rule.

#### 4. Gaussian Naive Bayes:
> Program that implements a 2-class Naive Bayes algorithm with an apriori decision
rule using a multinomial estimation for the classes and a gaussian estimation for the
attributes.

#### 5. KNN:
> Program that implements a 2-class kNN classifier with case base created by IB2 algorithm.
The assignment for the point is then determined by the sum of the weights per class, whereas the maximal sum is the
"winner".

#### 6. KMeans:
> program that implements the k-Means clustering. The
optimization criteria can be seen as a kind of Sum of Squared Errors.The goal is to
minimize J, which basically minimizes the sum of intra-cluster distances.
